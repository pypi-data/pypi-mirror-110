        ## Starter Project
        We've created [xero-python-outh2-starter](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-python-oauth2-starter) a project to demonstrate how to use this SDK.
        
        * oauth 2 flow to obtain a token
        * token refresh
        * identity to obtain tenant_id
        * organisation endpoint
        * create contact
        * create multiple contacts
        * get invoices using where clause
        
        Here is a [15 min video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8JWtbMo90M) on using the starter project.
        
        ## Kitchen Sync app
        We've created [xero-python-outh2-app](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-python-oauth2-app) a project to demonstrate how to make API calls and displays the python code used to make the call and the JSON response.
