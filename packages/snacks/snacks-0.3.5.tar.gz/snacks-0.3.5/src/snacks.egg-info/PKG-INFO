Description: # Snacks
        
        Snacks is a wrapper around [pika](https://pypi.org/project/pika/) to
        provide a convenient interface for RabbitMQ.
        
        ## Installation
        Snacks is available on PyPI and can be installed with:
        ```shell
        pip install snacks
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        ```python
        from snacks.rabbit import RabbitClient
        
        # These are all the default values if none are provided.
        rabbit = RabbitClient(
            host='localhost',
            port=5672,
            default_exchange='',
            virtual_host='/',
            username='guest',
            password='guest'
        )
        ```
        
        ## Consume From Queues
        To decorate a function as a consumer for a queue use the `consumer` decorator.
        ```python
        @rabbit.consumer('queue.name')
        def listen(event: str) -> None:
            print(f'Received request: {event}')
        ```
        
        
        ## Consume From Generated Queues
        To decorate a function as a consumer for a generated queue using given
        routing keys use the `listener` decorator.
        ```python
        @rabbit.listener('routing_key')
        def listen(event: str) -> None:
            print(f'Received request: {event}')
        ```
        
        ### RPC
        To make a decorated function a remote procedure add a return.
        ```python
        @rabbit.listener('routing_key')
        def listen(event: str) -> str:
            print(f'Received request: {event}')
            return 'Remote response.'
        ```
        
        ### Type Hint Based Deserialization
        If the request body in a decorated function has type hints, snacks will
        try to map the received data to that type. This has added support for
        [Dataclasses JSON](https://github.com/lidatong/dataclasses-json) or any
        other class with a `from_json` method.
        ```python
        @dataclass_json
        @dataclass
        class Event:
            type: str
            data: Any
        
        
        @rabbit.listener('routing_key')
        def user_event(event: Event) -> None:
            print(f'Received {event.type} with data {event.data}')
        ```
        
        
        ## Full Example
        
        ```python
        from snacks.rabbit import RabbitClient
        
        # Setup
        rabbit = RabbitClient(default_exchange='snacks')
        queue = 'snacks'
        key = 'snackey'
        rabbit.exchange_declare(exchange_type='topic', durable=True)
        rabbit.queue_declare(queue=queue, durable=True)
        rabbit.queue_bind(queue=queue, routing_key=key)
        
        
        @rabbit.consumer([queue])
        def listen(event: str) -> str:
            print(f'Received request: {event}')
            return 'Rabbits and pikas are snacks.'
        
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            r = rabbit.publish_and_receive(
                'To a python.', key, deserialize=bytes.decode
            )
            print(f'Received response: {r}')
        ```
        
        Output:
        ```
        Received request: To a python.
        Received response: Rabbits and pikas are snacks.
        ```
