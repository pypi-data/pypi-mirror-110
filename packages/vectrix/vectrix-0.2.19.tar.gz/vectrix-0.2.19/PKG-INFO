# Overview

Vectrix is a platform that allows security teams and companies to easily bootstrap their detection capabilities across their cloud environments and third-party services in minutes.

This is possible thanks to Vectrix Detection Packs, the individual, automated scripts and tools that are used to scan for a predetermined security issue, risk, or misconfiguration.

Detection Packs found on Vectrix are created by security engineers and developers through a development process managed by the Vectrix team. Development includes writing the scan logic that enables a module to detect (and often remediate) when an issue is identified.

# Details

This is the Vectrix Python 3 SDK for creating vectrix detection packs. For more information on creating a module yourself, please visit: https://developer.vectrix.io

# Installation

- `pip3 install vectrix`
