class USSD(Charge):

    """
    Flutterwave allows you to collect payments from your customers offline using USSD. With USSD payments,
     you call our APIs to create a charge, then give your customer instructions to complete the
     payment on her/his mobile phone. Once payment is completed we notify you on your webhook.

    At the moment, banks available for USSD payments (and their numeric codes) are:
    Fidelity Bank -- (070),
    Guaranty Trust Bank -- (058),
    Keystone Bank -- (082),
    Sterling Bank -- (232),
    United Bank for Africa -- (033),
    Unity Bank -- (215), and
    Zenith Bank -- (057).]

    When you call the initiate method you would receive the JSON response above with a note field that contains
    the USSD code for your customer to dial to complete their payment.
    Then we call your webhook once the transaction has been completed with a successful response.
