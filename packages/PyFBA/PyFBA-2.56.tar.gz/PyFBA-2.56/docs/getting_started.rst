Getting started with PyFBA
==========================

The first thing you probably want to do is build a model for your
genome. Because of the tight interplay between RAST, SEED, and Model
SEED, the easiest way to get started is to run your genome through RAST.

Using the SBML file
-------------------

If you have done that and built the model using the Model SEED, you can
download the SBML file from RAST, and try either
`run\_fba\_sbml.py <example_code/run_fba_sbml.py>`__ or
`sbml\_to\_fba.py <example_code/sbml_to_fba.py>`__. Both of these should
give similar, but not identical answers to the answer that you got from
the model SEED\ `1 <#f1>`__\ .

Using the genome annotation
---------------------------

If you have downloaded the annotation, there are two essential steps
that you need to take to create a model:

1. Convert the genome annotation to reactions
2. Gapfill the reactions on different media.

Convert the genome annotation to reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the `example code <example_code>`__ to get started. First,
we will create a set of reactions from your genome. First, download the
assigned\_functions file from the genome directory, or get a list of all
funcational roles in your genome. Next, convert those to a list of
reactions, using one of two commands:

If you have an assigned\_functions file that has [peg, functional role]:

::

        python example_code/assigned_functions_to_reactions.py -a assigned_functions > reactions.list

or, if you just have a list of functional roles, one per line:

::

        python example_code/assigned_functions_to_reactions.py -r functional_roles > reactions.list

Build a gapfilled model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We build a model from the reactions and then try and gap fill it using
all of our approaches.

::

    python scripts/gapfill_from_reactions.py -r reactions.list -m MOPS_NoC_Alpha-D-Glucose.txt > out.txt 2> out.err

This will use the media file ``MOPS_NoC_Alpha-D-Glucose.txt`` and try
and gap fill the model so that it grows on this media.

--------------

1 The reason that the answers are similar, but not identical, is because
the linear solvers give slightly different answers. The Model SEED uses
a commercial linear solver, but you are probably using GLPK. `â†© <#a1>`__
