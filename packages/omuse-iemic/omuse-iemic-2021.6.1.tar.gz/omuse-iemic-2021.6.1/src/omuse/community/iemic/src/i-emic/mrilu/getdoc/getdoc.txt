 This program extracts the documentation lines from Fortran programs.
 These documentation lines can consist of comment lines and statement
 lines.  The lines to be extracted start after the comment line:
   C#begindoc
 and end just before the comment line:
   C#enddoc
 Only the extracted lines are copied, verbatim, to the output file.

 The program can be called in the following tree ways:
   getdoc
      The lines are read from the standard input file and the extracted
      lines are copied to the standard output file.
   getdoc <inpfilenm>
      The filename <inpfilenm> should have the suffix ".f" or ".F".
      The output filename is <inpfilenm> in which the suffix has changed
      to  ".txt".
      The lines are read from the input file <inpfilenm> and the extracted
      lines are copied to the output file.
   getdoc <inpfilenm> <outpfilenm>
      The filename <inpfilenm> should have the suffix ".f" or ".F".
      The lines are read from the input file <inpfilenm> and the extracted
      lines are copied to the output file <outpfilenm>.
