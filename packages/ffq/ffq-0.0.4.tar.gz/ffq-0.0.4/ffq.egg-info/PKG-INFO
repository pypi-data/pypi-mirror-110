        Fetch run information from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install ffq
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Fetch information of an SRA run and display it in the terminal
        ```
        ffq [SRR]
        ```
        where `[SRR]` is the run accession.
        
        ### Fetch information of multiple SRA runs and display it in the terminal
        ```
        ffq [SRR1] [SRR2] ...
        ```
        where `[SRR1]` and `[SRR2]` are run accessions.
        
        ### Write SRA run information to a single JSON file
        ```
        ffq -o [JSON_PATH] [SRRS]
        ```
        where `[JSON_PATH]` is the path to the JSON file that will contain run
        information and `[SRRS]` is a space-delimited list of one or more
        run accessions.
        
        ### Write SRA run information to multiple JSON files, one file per run
        ```
        ffq -o [OUT_DIR] --split [SRRS]
        ```
        where `[OUT_PATH]` is the path to directory to which to write the JSON files.
        Information about each run will be written to its own separate JSON file named
        `[ACCESSION].json`. `[SRRS]` is a space-delimited list of one or more
        run accessions.
        
        ### Fetch information of one or more SRA study (and all of their runs)
        ```
        ffq -t SRP [SRPS]
        ```
        where `[SRPS]` is a space-delimited list of one or more SRA study accessions. The output is a JSON-formatted string (or a JSON file if `-o` is provided) with study accessions as keys. When `--split` is also provided, each study is written to its own separate JSON.
        
        ### Fetch information of one or more GEO study (and all of their runs)
        ```
        ffq -t GSE [GSES]
        ```
        where `[GSES]` is a space-delimited list of one or more GEO study accessions. The output is a JSON-formatted string (or a JSON file if `-o` is provided) with study accessions as keys. When `--split` is also provided, each study is written to its own separate JSON.
        
        ### Fetch information of all studies (and all of their runs) in one or more papers
        ```
        ffq -t DOI [DOIS]
        ```
        where `[DOIS]` is a space-delimited list of one or more DOIs. The output is a JSON-formatted string (or a JSON file if `-o` is provided) with SRA study accessions as keys. When `--split` is also provided, each study is written to its own separate JSON.

        ## Downloading data
        `ffq` is specifically designed to download metadata and to facilitate obtaining links to sequence files. To download raw data from the links obtained with `ffq` you can use [`wget`](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/file-download.html#using-wget) or one of these tools: 
         - [`fasterq dump`](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/HowTo:-fasterq-dump)
         - [`pysradb`](https://github.com/saketkc/pysradb)
