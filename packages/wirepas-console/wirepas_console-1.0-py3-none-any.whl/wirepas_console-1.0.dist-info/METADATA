# Wirepas Console

Wirepas Console is a tool for configuring and monitoring Wirepas networks. It is
a graphical user interface for the [Wirepas MQTT
Library](https://github.com/wirepas/wirepas-mqtt-library). Wirepas Console is
provided as a Python wheel on the [Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/wirepas-console/) (PyPI) and it supports Linux,
macOS and Windows.



## Installation

You need to have at least Python 3.7 and `pip` installed on your operating
system to install Wirepas Console. Once you have a supported version of Python
installed, you can run the following command to install Wirepas Console from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wirepas-console/):

```bash
$ pip3 install wirepas-console
```

It is also possible to install Wirepas Console inside a Python virtual
environment, e.g. by using the Python standard
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html) module.

### Linux

Wirepas Console requires the [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/)
Python module on Linux systems. The module is not required on macOS or Windows.

To install PyGObject from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/):

```bash
$ pip3 install PyGObject
```

Depending on your Linux distribution, you may have to install extra
dependencies. The following command installs the required dependencies on Debian
or Ubuntu based systems:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-webkit2-4.0
```

For other common Linux distributions, please consult the PyGObject [Getting
Started](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) page.

## Usage

Once installed, Wirepas Console can be run from the command line:

```bash
$ wirepas-console
```

A webview window will open, presenting the user interface. Closing the window
will close Wirepas Console and return to shell prompt.

Another way to use Wirepas Console is with a web browser, without opening a
webview window:

```bash
$ wirepas-console --no-webview
```

The browser can then be pointed to
[http://localhost:1414](http://localhost:1414). In this mode Wirepas Console
must be manually closed by invoking a keyboard interrupt (Control-C).
