        transmitted and what response(s), if any, are permitted.


        resourceType: This is a MessageDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: The business identifier that is used to reference the MessageDefinition and
            *is* expected to be consistent from server to server.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this message definition when it
            is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
            design or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the message definition
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the message definition author and is not
            expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
            yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation
            that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the message definition. This name should
            be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
            such as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the message definition.

        replaces: A MessageDefinition that is superseded by this definition.

        status: The status of this message definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this message definition is authored for
            testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
            used for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the message definition was published. The
            date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the message definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the message
            definition.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the message definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate message
            definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the message definition is intended to be
            used.

        purpose: Explanation of why this message definition is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the message definition and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the message definition.

        base: The MessageDefinition that is the basis for the contents of this resource.

        parent: Identifies a protocol or workflow that this MessageDefinition represents a
            step in.

        eventCoding: Event code or link to the EventDefinition.

        eventUri: Event code or link to the EventDefinition.

        category: The impact of the content of the message.

        focus: Identifies the resource (or resources) that are being addressed by the event.
            For example, the Encounter for an admit message or two Account records for a
            merge.

        responseRequired: Declare at a message definition level whether a response is required or only
            upon error or success, or never.

        allowedResponse: Indicates what types of messages may be sent as an application-level response
            to this message.

        graph: Canonical reference to a GraphDefinition. If a URL is provided, it is the
            canonical reference to a [[[GraphDefinition]]] that it controls what resources
            are to be added to the bundle when building the document. The GraphDefinition
            can also specify profiles that apply to the various resources.
