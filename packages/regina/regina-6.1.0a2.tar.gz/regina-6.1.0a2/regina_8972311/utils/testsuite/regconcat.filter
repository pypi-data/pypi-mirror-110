# This filter is used when dumping the contents of a Regina data file.  It:
# - blanks out internal packet IDs (used in script variables), since
#   these are non-deterministic;
# - blanks out the regina version that created the file, so that the
#   test output is stable across different upstream releases.
#
# Note that BSD sed does not support \+, which is why we use \{1,\} instead.
