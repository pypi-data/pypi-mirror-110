Description: # Guarded
        
        Guarded is the interpreter of Dijkstra's guarded command language,
        written in python with ANTLR4 generator.
        
        Example of program in this language:
        ```
        a := 45;
        b := 15;
        
        do a != b ->
            if a > b -> a := a - b
            |  a < b -> b := b - a
            fi
        od
        ```
        
        ## Quick start:
        To start using interpreter, follow these steps:
        
        * Install gclang:
        ```console
          $ pip install gclang
        ```
        
        * Launch program of your choice with:
        ```console
