## Features


Color has been added to the welcome string which makes it more attractive.
For now there are 5 different colors they are

<ul>
<li>red
</li>
<li>green
</li>
<li>blue</li>
<li>yellow</li>
<li>purple</li>
</ul>

Users are allowed to pass the color name as an optional attribute, if the color you entered is not present in the mentioned above colors then it will print in the default color
<ul>
<li>Windows --> black</li>
<li>Linux --> white</li>
</ul>

Wstring is now platform independent and it works even in cmd in windows and terminal in linux

New exceptions has been included
