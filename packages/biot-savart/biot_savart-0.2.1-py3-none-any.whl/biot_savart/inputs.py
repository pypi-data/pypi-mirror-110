    '''
    Parses 4 column CSV into x,y,z,I slices for coil.

    Each (x,y,z,I) entry defines a vertex on the coil.

    The current I of the vertex, defines the amount of
    current running through the next segment of coil, in amperes.

    i.e. (0, 0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 1, 4) means that:
    - There are 2 amps of current running between points 1 and 2
    - There are 3 amps of current running between points 2 and 3
    - The last bit of current is functionally useless.
