# Shape4D

## About Shape4D

Shape4D is a tiny library for point, line and polygon in 3D space, as well as their simple relations.


## Core Features
- Shape classes: Point, Line and Polygon.
- Creating a 3D polygon by defining a 2D shape in working plane at first and then moving it to its desired position.
- It provides functions to judge whether a point is contained in a shape, either line or polygon, by overloading the magic function  `__contains__`.
- `__hash__` and `__eq__`, overloaded for point, line and polygon.
- `__neg__` overloaded for polygon when one wants to know the vertices on its other side.


## Requirements

* [Python](http://www.python.org) 3 
* Matplotlib is installed.

## Documentation

To be continued.

## Installation
```bash
pip install Shape4D
```

## Usage
```Python
import Shape4D.VisualShapes as vs
W,H = 2.0,1.5
shape = vs.Shape('rectangle',W,H)
shape = shape.move(to = (2,0,0), by = (45,30))

line = vs.Polyline((0,0,0),(3,1.,2))
P = shape.intercept(line)
line.broken_by(P)

shape.plot(hideAxes=True,style = {'facecolor':'cornflowerblue', 'edgecolor':'navy'})
shape.add_plot(line,style={'color':'k','linewidth':2,'node':'visible'})
shape.show(azim=-20, elev=3)
```
