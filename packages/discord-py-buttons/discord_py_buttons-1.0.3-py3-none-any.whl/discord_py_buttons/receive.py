        Specifies if the message was done with text-to-speech.
        This can only be accurately received in :func:`on_message` due to
        a discord limitation.
    type: :class:`MessageType`
        The type of message. In most cases this should not be checked, but it is helpful
        in cases where it might be a system message for :attr:`system_content`.
    author: :class:`abc.User`
        A :class:`Member` that sent the message. If :attr:`channel` is a
        private channel or the user has the left the guild, then it is a :class:`User` instead.
    content: :class:`str`
        The actual contents of the message.
    nonce
        The value used by the discord guild and the client to verify that the message is successfully sent.
