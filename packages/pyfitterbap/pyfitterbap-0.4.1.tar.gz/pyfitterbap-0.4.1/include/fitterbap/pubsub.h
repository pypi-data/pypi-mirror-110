 * @brief Publish to a topic.

 * @param self The PubSub instance.
 * @param topic The topic to update.
 * @param value The new value for the topic.
 * @param src_fn The callback function for the source subscriber
 *      that is publishing the update.  Can be NULL.

 *
 * If the topic does not already exist, this function will
 * automatically create it.
 *
 * The src_fn and src_user_data provide trivial, built-in support
 * to ensure that a publisher/subscriber does not receive their
 * own updates.  One deduplication technique is for each
 * subscriber to compare values. However, some PubSub instances,
 * such as communication bridges between PubSub instances,
 * would need to duplicate the full PubSub state.
 * This approach greatly simplifies implementing a
 * subscriber that also publishes to the same topics.
 *
 * This modules supports two types of pointer types.  Values marked with
 * the FBP_UNION_FLAG_CONST remain owned by the caller.  The values
 * must remain valid until the pubsub instance completes publishing.
 * If also marked with FBP_UNION_FLAG_RETAIN, the value must remain
 * valid until a new value publishes.  We only recommend using this
 * method with "static const" values.  Note that properly freeing a
 * pointer type is not trivial, since publishing is asynchronous and
 * subscriber calling order is not guaranteed.
 *
 * One "trick" to freeing pointers is to publish two messages:
 * first one with the pointer and then one with NULL.
 * If the publisher also subscribes, then they can free the pointer
 * when they receive the NULL value.  However, this requires that
 * all subscribers only operated on the pointer during the subscriber
 * callback and do not hold on to it.
 *
 * The second pointer type is dynamically managed by the pubsub instance.
 * FBP_UNION_FLAG_RETAIN is NOT allowed for these pointer types as
 * they are only temporarily allocated in a circular buffer.
 * If the item is too big to ever fit, this function returns
 * FBP_ERROR_PARAMETER_INVALID.
 * If the circular buffer is full, this function returns
 * FBP_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY.  The caller can optionally wait and retry.
