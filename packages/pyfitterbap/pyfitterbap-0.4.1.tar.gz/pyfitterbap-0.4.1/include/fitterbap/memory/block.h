 *
 * @brief A block-based allocator.
 *
 * This block based allocator is a simple form of a heap.  It allocates
 * the provided memory using fixed size blocks.  This allocator does suffer
 * from fragmentation and variable (but bounded) allocation time.  This
 * allocator is best used for objects with variable runtime size that are
 * allocated and deallocated together.
 *
 * The allocation information (the struct fbp_mblock_s) is stored
 * separated from the managed memory which can be necessary in many cases.
 * A typical use of this block based allocator is to manage the USB device
 * endpoint memory buffers.
 *
 * This implementation is not thread safe.
 *
