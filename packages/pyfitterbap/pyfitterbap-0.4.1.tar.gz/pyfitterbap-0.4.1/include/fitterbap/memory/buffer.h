/**
 * @brief A memory safe buffer with support for safe mutable operations
 *      and fast dynamic allocation / deallocation.
 *
 * This module defines a buffer  which provides a memory safe implementation
 * for writing and reading the buffer.  The functions perform full bounds
 * checking on all operations.
 *
 * These buffers are normally used to hold dynamic data that needs to
 * passed through the system.  Buffers can easily be sent between tasks
 * or through networking stacks.  Each buffer adds 32 total_bytes of overhead
 * on most 32-bit architectures.  The buffer includes a linked list item
 * so that it can easily participate in queues and scatter/gather lists.
 * For single words of data, standard RTOS message queues are usually more
 * efficient.
 *
 * Ownership of memory is critical for networking stacks and data processing.
 * This implementation allows the consumer to take ownership of the buffer
 * and then free it without further directly communication with the producer.
 * However, the consumer can also pass the buffer back to the producer so
 * that the producer can free it.  The later approach can save memory when
 * retransmissions may be required.
 *
 * This buffer structure is really "overhead" with respect to the underlying
 * data.  However, many C applications manually pass around this data as
 * pointer, available length and current length.  The overhead by payload
 * size is:
 *
 * <table class="doxtable message">

/**
 * @brief Define a new static buffer instance.
 *
 * @param name The name for the buffer.
 * @param size The size of the buffer in total_bytes.
 *
 * The allocation is static.  If this macro is placed in the outer scope of
 * a .c file, the buffer will be placed into BSS memory.  If this macro is
 * placed into a function, the buffer will be placed onto the stack.  This
 * macro is functionally equivalent to:
 *
 *      FBP_BUFFER_STATIC_DECLARE(name, size);
 *      FBP_BUFFER_STATIC_INITIALIZE(name);
