 * @brief The value to use for all fbp sizes.
 *
 * The use of signed and unsigned types for lengths/sizes, which are in the
 * domain of positive integers, is a debated topic.  Here are some references:
 * - http://www.soundsoftware.ac.uk/c-pitfall-unsigned
 * - http://blog.robertelder.org/signed-or-unsigned/
 * - https://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2009/08/a-tutorial-on-signed-and-unsigned-integers/
 *
 * In the opinion of the FBP authors, signed integers should be used except
 * for bit operations (~ & | ^ << >>) and applications using modulo arithmetic,
 * such as cryptography.  Unfortunately, C does not perform saturation
 * arithmetic by default which opens up a whole class of potential errors.
 * With both signed and unsigned operations, the application is responsible
 * for checking overflows and underflows.  C's automatic promotion from signed
 * to unsigned is a problem, but you are using
 * "-Wall -Werror -Wpedantic -Wextra", right?
