 * @brief Event manager.
 *
 * This module contains an event manager for scheduling, cancelling, and
 * processing events based upon the passage of time.  This module is intended
 * to allow event scheduling within a single thread.  It provides an optional
 * locking mechanism through fbp_evm_register_mutex() and
 * fbp_evm_register_schedule_callback() to support accesses
 * from multiple threads.
