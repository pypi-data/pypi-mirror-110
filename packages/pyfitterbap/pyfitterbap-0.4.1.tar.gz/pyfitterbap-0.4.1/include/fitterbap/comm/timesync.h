 *
 * @brief A simple time synchronization protocol.
 *
 * This module implements a simple time synchronization method using
 * the client's fbp_time_counter() and the server-provide UTC time.
 *
 * The server is always considered as time source truth.  If an
 * implementation uses multiple servers, then only one server
 * connection should be connected to update UTC time.
