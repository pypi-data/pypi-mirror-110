 * @ingroup fbp_comm
 * @defgroup fbp_comm_data_link Data link layer for byte streams
 *
 * @brief Provide reliable framing and retransmission over byte
 *      streams, such as UARTs.
 *
 * This module provides a reliable data link layer for message transmission
 * over byte streams.  The data link uses
 * Selective Repeat Automated Repeat Request (SR-ARQ).  The protocol
 * features rapid no acknowledgements (NACK) which helps minimize the
 * RAM buffering requirements for the protocol.
 *
 * The framing is provided by the @ref fbp_framer.
 *
 * The features of this data link include:
 *
 * - Robust framing using SOF bytes, length, and CRC32.
 * - Fast recovery on errors for minimal RAM usage.
 * - Reliable transmission with acknowledgements and not acknowledgements.
 * - Guaranteed in-order delivery.
 * - Multiple pending transmit frames for maximum throughput.
 * - 16-bits of arbitrary metadata per frame to support:
 *   - multiplexing using "ports"
 *   - Segmentation and reassembly with start & stop bits.
 *   - Message identification
 * - Full statistics, including frames transferred.
 *
 * For extremely fast transmitters (UART CDC over USB), the maximum number of
 * outstanding frames and acknowledgement turn-around time limit the total
 * rate.  USB has a typically response time of 2 milliseconds, which this
 * framer easily accommodates.  The implementation presumes that this framer
 * is running in the same thread as the receive message processing and
 * can keep up with the raw data rate.
 *
 * The protocol consists of two different frame formats:
 * - data frame
 * - link frame used by acks, nacks, and reset
 *
 * See @ref fbp_framer for the frame details.
 *
 *
 * ## Why another protocol?
 *
 * As described below, this data link layer implements 1990's
 * technology.  A number of decent protocols UART-style protocols
 * exist, but performance is not great.  When designs need
 * robust performance, TCP/IP is the proven solution.  Unfortunately,
 * TCP/IP through a stack like lwIP requires significant code
 * space and RAM.  Also performance is not great.  This library
 * easily and efficiently handles 3 Mbaud connections.
 *
 *
 * ## Retranmissions
 *
 * This data link layer provides reliable message delivery with
 * error detection and retransmissions.  The implemention uses
 * Selective Repeat Automated Repeat Request (SR-ARQ), similar to
 * what TCP of TCP/IP uses.
 *
 * The transmitter constructs and sends frames with an incrementing frame_id
 * that rolls over to zero after reaching the maximum.  When the receiver
 * receives the next frame in the sequence, it sends an ACK_ALL back to the
 * sender.  When the sender receives an ACK_ALL, it can recycle the frame
 * buffers for all frame_ids up to the ACK_ALL.
 *
 * If the receiver sees a skip in frame_id values, it immediately sends
 * a NACK for the missing frame along with an ACK_ONE for the valid frame.
 * When the receive finally receives the missing frame_id, it will respond
 * with ACK_ALL with the frame_id for the group.
 *
 * The transmitter can have at most frame_id_max / 2 frames - 1 outstanding,
 * which we call frame_pend_max.  The receiver treats
 * frame_id - frame_pend_max (computed with wrap) as the "past" and
 * frame_id + frame_pend_max (computed with wrap) as the "future".
 *
 * When the receiver receives a "past" frame, the receiver discards the frame
 * but does send an ACK to the transmitter.
 * If the receiver receives a "future" frame beyond the expected next frame_id,
 * the the receiver must have missed at least one frame.  If the skipped
 * frame was previously idle, then the receiver immediately sends a
 * NACK_FRAME_ID for the skipped frame and marks it as NACKed.
 * If it is skipped again, the
 * receiver does not generate a NACK_FRAME_ID.  Retranmission then relies
 * upon the transmitter timeout.
 *
 * If the received frame is beyond the receive window, then the receiver
 * response with NACK.  Otherwise, it response with ACK_ONE and stores
 * the frame to a buffer.  The receiver will continue to store other
 * future frames and reply with ACK_ONE.  When it finally receives the
 * skipped frame, it replies with ACK_ALL with the most recent frame_id
 * corresponding with no skips.
 *
 * If the receiver receives a framing error,
 * it immediately sends a NACK_FRAMING_ERROR containing the frame_id
 * of the expected frame.
 *
 * When the transmitter receives a NACK, it normally complete the current
 * frame transmission.  The transmitter should then
 * retransmit starting with the frame_id indicated in the NACK.  The
 * transmitter knows the outstanding frames.
 *
 * The transmitter also contains a timeout.  If the transmitter does not
 * receive an ACK without the timeout, it will retransmit the frame.
 * The transmitter will retransmit indefinitely, but will indicate an
 * error after a threshold.
 *
 * This framer contains support for backpressure by providing notifications
 * when the recipient acknowledge the frame transmission.
 * The application can configure the desired number of pending
 * send frames based upon memory availability and application complexity.
 *
 *
 * ## Bandwidth analysis
 *
 * The protocol provides support for up to 2 ^ 11 / 2  - 1 = 1023 frames in flight.
 * With maximum payload size of 256 total_bytes and 10 total_bytes overhead on a 3 Mbaud link,
 * the protocol is capable of a maximum outstanding duration of:
 *
 *     (1023 * (256 + 10)) / (3000000 / 10) = 0.907 seconds
 *
 * However, the transmitter must have a transmit buffer of at least 272,118 total_bytes,
 * too much for many intended microcontrollers.  A typical microcontroller may
 * allocate 32 outstanding frames, which is 8512 total_bytes.  To prevent stalling the
 * link with full payloads, the transmitter receive must ACK within:
 *
 *     (32 * (256 + 10)) / (3000000 / 10) = 28 milliseconds
 *
 * For memory efficiency, the protocol uses a variable message sized
 * ring buffer to store the transmit messages, which keeps bandwidth
 * fast even for small-sized messages.  The receive side uses
 * dedicated, full-frame-sized buffers.  In the common case where
 * the microcontroller to host path contains far more data than the
 * host to microcontroller path, this allows a reduced microcontroller
 * memory footprint.  Maintaining a variable length received buffer
 * is much more complicated due to out of order reception and
 * message retirement.
 *
 * The required RAM buffer is a function of the
 * [bandwidth-delay product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product).
 * You typically want at least twice the bandwidth-delay product of buffering
 * with SR-ARQ to keep maximum data rates.  Less demanding applications
 * can reduce the RAM buffer.
 *
 * Direct communication between microcontrollers with fast interrupt handling
 * and low delays can use small buffers.  Communication to a host computer
 * requires larger buffers due to the host computer delay variability.
 * Under Windows, you may want to ensure that your timer resolution is set to
 * 1 millisecond or less.  You can use
 * [TimerTool](https://github.com/tebjan/TimerTool) to check.
