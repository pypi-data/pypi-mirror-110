     * On response, the payload contains:
     * - one byte containing (32 + port_id)
     * - a NULL-terminated JSON formatted string.
     *
     * The JSON response structure consists of:
     * - name: A user-meaningful "name" key.
     * - type: The port type, which is one of
     *   oam, pubsub, stream, msg, sample
     *
     * Types define other keys:
     * - oam: Operations, administration and management.  This port 0 only.
     * - pubsub: The publish-subscribe port.  Not other keys defined.
     * - text: Provides UTF-8 text communication, often for a command console,
     *   such as SCPI.  The "protocol" key describes the actual protocol.
     * - stream: An data stream with custom format.
     * - msg: Raw messages with custom payload format.
     * - wave_src: Produce binary data samples.  Each message on this
     *   port contains a 32-bit sample identifier corresponding to the first
     *   sample in the message followed by packed sample data.
     *   The additional metadata keys are:
     *   - prefix: The PubSub topic prefix for controlling this stream.
     *     See below for the required subtopics.
     *   The sample PubSub subtopics are:
     *   - ctrl: bool on/off for the binary sample stream
     *   - fs: The maximum available frequency for this stream (ro)
     *   - div: The optional available sampling frequency divisor(s)
     *   - format: The optional list of supported data formats.  Formats include:
     *     - Single bit is b.  This format is packed with bit N in
     *       byte 0, bit 0.  Bit N+1 goes to byte 0, bit 1.
     *       Bit N+8 goes to byte 1, bit 0.
     *     - IEEE floating point is either f32 or f64.
     *     - Signed integers are iZ where Z is a multiple of 4.
     *     - Unsigned integer are uZ where Z is a multiple of 4.
     *     - Signed fixed-point integers are iMqN where M+N is a multiple of 4.
     *     - Unsigned fixed-point integers are uMqN where M+N is a multiple of 4.
     *   - compress: The optional list of available compression algorithms.
     *
     *   The integer types are fully packed in little-endian format.  For types
     *   with odd nibbles. The even samples are represented "normally", and the odd
     *   samples fill their most significant nibble in the upper 4 bits of the same
     *   byte occupied by the even sample's most significant nibble.
     *
     * - wave_sink: Receive binary data samples from a wave_src at
     *   the other end of the connection.
     *
     * If the port is not defined, respond with an empty string "" consisting
     * of only the NULL terminator.
