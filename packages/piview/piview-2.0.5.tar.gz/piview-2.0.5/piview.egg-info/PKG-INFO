PiView provides the details of the Raspberry Pi currently being interrogated.

## General Information

* Free software: Open Software License ("OSL") v. 3.0
* Documentation: https://piview.readthedocs.io.


## Features

PiView provides system information including, but not limited to:

|  Group   | Information                                                           |
|:--------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU      | max load across cores, temperature, clock speed                       |
| GPU      | temperature                                                           |
| HARDWARE | bluetooth, i2c, spi, camera statuses                                  |
| HOST     | boot time, model, name, revision, serial number, uptime               |
| NETWORK  | host name, interface names, ip addresses, mac addresses               |
| STORAGE  | total disk capacity, free disk capacity, total RAM and free RAM       |

Also includes a small utility library with:

- conversion of bytes into Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes and up
- create list with a quartet of integer numbers representing the IPv4 Address


## Requirements

This project requires the following package(s):

* `psutils`

Remaining packages are Python 'built-ins'.

## Building



## Credits

A very large thank you to Matt Hawkins upon whose code this package is based: https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/

# History

## 3.0.0 (TBA)

This will contain some 'breaking' changes.

* All results will be returned as dictionary with reading type and value
* Recreate the testing methods
* Update online documentation
* Deprecate the PiView_AG edition
* Code contains list of TODO elements - showing improvements / new features

## 2.0.3 (2021-05-30)

* Minor edits to code.
* CPU speed returns random value if parameter `random=True` used in call, or -1 when parameter `random=False` (or omitted)
* Temperatures return -273.16ÂºC when no reading given (absolute zero)
* Keeping documentation edits within this version until next minor update to code

## 2.0.2 (2021-05-28)

* Minor Fixes

## 2.0.1 (2021-05-27)

* Updated Package release.


## 1.0.0 Initial Release
Some enhancements to come - such as return all the attached
storage statistics

Added:

- python version (HOST)
- camera supported / detected (HARDWARE)

## 0.5.0 RAM, Storage, Host

Added the following:

- ram total and free
- storage total and free for 'all disks' in total
- name to Host, this is a temporary version until further investigation done, use the host
  name method in the network section to get host name

To do:

- statistics (total space, free) for each attached storage device


## 0.4.0 Network Features

The following are implemented in this version:

- host name
- interface names
