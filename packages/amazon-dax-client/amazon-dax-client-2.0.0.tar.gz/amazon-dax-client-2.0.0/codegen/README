README
======
The code generator takes the model files (in models/) and constructs a working
model. It then uses Jinja2 to pass that model to the templates (in templates/)
and produces files in generated-src/. All of these directories can be changed
but this is the basic structure that should be followed.

Prep
----
Use pip to download the necessary modules:

  cd codegen
  python -m pip install -t ./.pip -r requirements.txt
  cd ..

This only has to be done once, after checkout.

Run
---
To run the code generators, from the root of the DaxPythonClient checkout:

  PYTHONPATH=codegen/.pip python3 codegen/codegen.py models templates amazondax/generated


Results
-------
The geneated files will be in generated-src.
