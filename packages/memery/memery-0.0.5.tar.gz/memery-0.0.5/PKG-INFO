        > Search over large image datasets with natural language and computer vision!
        
        
        ## Install
        
        The necessary CLIP and torch packages will be installed by pip. You might want to make sure you have a sane CUDA environment before and after this step if you're trying to use GPU. If you don't have a GPU, `memery` should still work on your CPU. 
        
        If you have any trouble please **open an issue on Github**! I want to make this package useful for as many people as possible. Help me know what's going wrong :)
        
        `pip install memery`
        
        ## How to use
        
        ### Use GUI
        
        The browser GUI is a Streamlit app. You can run it from the command line with 
        
        `memery serve`
        
        or set up a desktop shortcut to use it from your menu.
        
        If you're in a Jupyter environment, you can summon the GUI directly into an output cell like this:
        
        
        ```
        from memery.gui import appPage
        
        ```
        
        ```
        app = appPage()
        display(app)
        ```
        
        
            <memery.gui.appPage at 0x7f6c0e7c80d0>
        
        
        ### Use CLI
        
        From the command line, you can use `memery` on any folder and it will search for images recursively, returning a list object to stdout.
        
        Pass the --n flag to control how many images are returned (default 10).
        
        `memery PATH/TO/IMAGE/FOLDER 'query' --n 20
        `
        
        ### Use as a library
        
        Simply use `queryFlow` to search over a folder recursively! The folder will be indexed, if an index doesn't already exist. Then any new images will be CLIP-encoded, an Annoy treemap built, and a list of ranked filenames returned.
        
        ```
        from memery.core import queryFlow
        from memery.gui import get_grid
        ```
        
        ```
        ranked = queryFlow('./images', 'dad joke')
        
        print(ranked[:5])
        ```
