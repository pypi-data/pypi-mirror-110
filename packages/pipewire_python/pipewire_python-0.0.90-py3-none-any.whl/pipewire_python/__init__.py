## Description

[PIPEWIRE](https://pipewire.org/) provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine
on top of audio and video devices that can be used to
support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio
and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model
that makes interacting with audio and video devices from 
containerized applications easy, with supporting Flatpak
applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and
Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block 
for the future of Linux application development.

[pipewire_python](https://pypi.org/project/pipewire_python/) 
controlls `pipewire` via terminal, creating shell commands and executing them as required.

üéπ There are two ways to manage the python package:

1. NO_ASYNC: this way works as expected with delay time between 
`pipewire_python` and the rest of your code.

2. ASYNC: [‚ö†Ô∏èNot yet implemented] this way works delegating the task to record or to play
a song file in background. Works with threads.

3. MULTIPROCESS: [‚ö†Ô∏èNot yet implemented] Works with processes.
