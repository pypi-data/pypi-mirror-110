## Open Source Peatio Deployed Exchange API

This is an unofficial Python wrapper for the [Peatio exchange REST API v2](https://www.openware.com/sdk/2.3/docs/peatio/api/peatio-user-api-v2.html). I am in no way affiliated with Openware Peatio Project, use at your own risk.

If you came here looking for the exchange to purchase cryptocurrencies, then go [here](https://www.binance.com/en). 

If you want to automate interactions with Peatio Exchanges stick around.
