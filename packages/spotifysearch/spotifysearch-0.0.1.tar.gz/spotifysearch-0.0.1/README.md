## SpotifySearch

A complete wrapper for the Search API provided by Spotify written in Python.

It has built-in classes that helps you access the data returned by Spotify, alongside with useful methods for exporting data.

Check the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/) for more information on classes and methods.


### What you can do

- Get Spotify catalog information about albums, artists or tracks that match a keyword string.
- Easily access the information provided by Spotify using specific class attributes and methods, such as **name**, **id**, **url** and many more.
- Access and export audio and image files, such as album covers for example.
### Installation
SpotifySearch depends on **[requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)**. You can easily install it by using **PIP**
```bash
python -m pip install requests
```

Then, you can safely install SpotifySearch using the following command:
```bash
python -m pip install spotifysearch
```

### Testing your installation
You can test your installation using python interactive shell
```python
>>> import spotifysearch
```
### Getting access to the API
To get access to Spotify Search API, you need to have a Spotify account to get an access token, which is required by the API itself. <br>
You can [register an account](https://www.spotify.com/signup/) if you don't have one.

Then, you need to login into your account in [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login).
Once you have successfully logged in, go to your **Dashboard**, and create a new application.<br> 
You should see something like this:
![create application form](https://i.imgur.com/x6GqwBR.png)

Once you've created your application, you'll receive a **client ID** and a **client secret**. These are your credentials, you should store them in a safe environment.

âš  **Be careful to not accidentally share your credentials. They are the keys to access the API and are linked to your account.**

### Making your first call
So now that you have your **credentials**, you can start making your calls to the API. 

Open your editor and run the following code:

```python
# First, we import our Client class from spotifysearch.client
from spotifysearch.client import Client


# Then, we create an instance of that class passing our credentials as arguments.
# Do not upload your code with your credentials. You should use Environment Variables instead.
myclient = Client("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")


# Now we can call the method search() from our client and store the results in a variable called results as well
results = myclient.search("Never gonna give you up")


# Then we call the method get_tracks() from our results object, which returns a list of tracks
tracks = results.get_tracks()


# Now, let's access the first track in our list by using index 0
track = tracks[0]


# Finally, we can access some information contained in our track.
print(track.name, "-", track.artists[0].name)
print(track.url)

```


**This should be your result:**
```bash
Never Gonna Give You Up Rick - Rick Astley
https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT?si=12872781c22c49f9
```
<br>

That seems to be a lot of code, but it's actually not. 
Let's remove all comments and and see what our code looks like.
```python
from spotifysearch.client import Client

myclient = Client("YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
results = myclient.search("Never gonna give you up")
tracks = results.get_tracks()
track = tracks[0]
print(track.name, "-", track.artists[0].name)

```
In a few lines of code, we got access to the API, retrieved and displayed some useful information.

There are a lot of class attributes and methods that you can use to retrieve the information you need, you can check them out in the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/).
