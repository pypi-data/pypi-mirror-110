## Documentation

Check out a [comprehensive example](https://github.com/BrainStormYourWayIn/sierra_doc/blob/main/doc.py) of its use

________________________________

### Issues

- We're aware of issues surrounding naming of the HTML and CSS. As of now, the HTML and the CSS are named `index.html` and `style.css` by default.
- We're also aware this can cause conflicts when creating multi-paged web applications unless pages other than the main page are in different folders.
- We're working on this and is going to rectified in the next mini-release that is coming very soon
