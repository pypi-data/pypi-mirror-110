# CMLBIB: Curated ML .bib for LaTeX

Is your bibliography inconsistent? Does it include the year or month in one entry but not in others? Are some entries all-caps and others in Title Case? ... Does it list enties as ArXiv pre-preprints while they are published in conferences?

CMLBIB attempts to solve this by 
1. maintaining curated .bib entries for papers in top ML conferences 
2. providing a tool that automatically matches your .bib entries to ours and fixing them for you.

# Installation

CMLBIB is in PyPI. You can install using
```sh
pip install cmlbib
```
