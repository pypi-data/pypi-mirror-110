        ![alt text](docs/logo-small.png)
        
        A toy BitTorrent client written in python, based on the official [specs](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html).
        
        ## What it can do
        
        - Download of single-file torrents from peer!
        - Save download state beetwen sessions, and start again at a later time
        
        ## What it can SOMEWHAT do
        
        - Reach acceptable speed downloads (I may have a very low bar)
        
        ## What it can NOT do
        
        - Download of multiple-file torrents
        - Support DHT, Message Stream Encryption or any other extension 
        - Manage more than one download at a time (although you could spawn more than one Fiume process to do that)
        - Download from more than one peer concurrently
        - Offer a decent CLI or GUI
        - It can download, but I'm not so sure about uploading (correctly)
