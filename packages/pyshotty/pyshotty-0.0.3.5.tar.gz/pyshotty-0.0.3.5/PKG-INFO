        ## A firefox selenium based screenshot package for use with flask  
        
        Error while running selenium in a flask route brought me to create this.
        
        Although that I realised soon my error was elsewhere, I now have a condensed easy format to grab website screenshots
        
        ## Prerequisites 
        
        * Ubuntu 
        * Firefox   `sudo apt-get install firefox`
        * geckodriver `sudo apt-get install firefox-geckodriver`
        
        ## Features
        
        * Grab screenshots from any website (in .png, .jpg or PIL image format)
        * Choose browser size (essentially screenshot size)
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Download and install can be done through PyPi
        
        ```
        pip install pyshotty
        ```
        or
        
        ```python
        git clone https://github.com/lewis-morris/pyshotty
        cd pyshotty 
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Pending Features
        
        * Alternative image formats
        * grab via Chrome selenium
        * passing command line parameters
        
        ## How to use
        
        ### Minimal working example
        
        ```python
        
        from pyshotty import Firefox
        
        screen = Firefox()
        filename = screen.grab("www.google.com")
        
        ```
        output:  /tmp/tempscreenshot.png
        
        ![Image](examples/tempscreenshot.png)
        
        ### Full Example 
        I always find it best to learn by example so follow this jupyter notebook to see the flow.

        All classes have doc strings, so you can always check there if you get stuck.
