**Intents** is a unofficial Python library to define and operate Dialogflow Agents with a simple,
code-first approach.

## Project status

This project is in **alpha** stage, some API adjustments are to be expected before
release. A detailed view of available features can be found in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)

## Install

*Intents* can be installed as follows:

```sh
pip install intents
```

## Usage

Intents are defined like standard Python **dataclasses**:

```python
@dataclass
class HelloIntent(Intent):
    """A little docstring for my Intent class"""
    user_name: Sys.Person = "Guido"
```

Their **language** resources are stored in separate YAML files:

```yaml
utterances:
  - Hi! My name is $user_name{Guido}
  - Hello there, I'm $user_name{Mario}

responses:
  default:
    text:
      - Hi $user_name
      - Hello $user_name
      - Nice to meet you, $user_name
```

Agents can be **uploaded** into Dialogflow ES projects directly from code; *Intents* will act transparently as a prediction client:

```python
df = DialogflowEsConnector('/path/to/service-account.json', MyAgent)
df.upload()  # You will find it in your Dialogflow Console

predicted = df.predict("Hi there, my name is Mario")  # HelloIntent(user_name="Mario")
print(predicted.fulfillment_text)                     # "Hello Mario"
```

For a complete working example, check out the included [Example Agent](example_agent/). Also, *Intents* **documentation** is published at https://intents.readthedocs.io/ ðŸ“š
