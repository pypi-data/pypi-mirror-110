> For when Poetry just doesn't work.

Have you tried setting up [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but something doesn't work? Maybe you're...

- Trying to implement Github Actions but the commands don't register.
- Testing on a computer that doesn't have Poetry installed.
- Just wanting to test out a package without any of these crazy dependency managers.

If so, then you're in the right place!

```console
$ pip install ballad
```

Want to install dependencies? Run:

```console
