# Pygame Popup Manager

Pygame Popup Manage is a very small engine permitting to easily build all kind of popup in a pygame project.

Here is an example of basic menus that could be created with this manager:

# Installation


# Use


# Customization

Unfortunatelly, the customization is limited for the moment.

But you can still provide your own graphical assets to the components, as you can see in the screenshot below.
