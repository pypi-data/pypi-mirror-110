================

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n), form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1. (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`_)
