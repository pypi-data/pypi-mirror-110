Python-Datastructures is a Python library containing implementations of various data structures written purely in Python. Useful when preparing for interviews or building school projects. Allow the user to focus on developing your algorithms and not worry about finding python implementations of classic data structures.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install python-datastructures.

```bash
pip install python-datastructures
```

## Usage

Sample usage of the library. Import any datastructure from the list of supported datastructures.

- Stack
- Queue
- DeQueue
- SinglyLinkedList
- DoublyLinkedList
- CircularList
- MaxHeap
- MinHeap
- Trie

![](assets/demo.webp)

```python
from python_datastructures import MinHeap

arr = [2,3,18,29,7,82,1,9]
heap = MinHeap(arr)
print(heap.peek()) # returns 1
```

## Documentation
