        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install torch_pitch_shift
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        # import the libs
        import torch
        from torch_pitch_shift import *
        
        # create a random sample
        NUM_CHANNELS = 2
        SAMPLE_RATE = 44100
        NUM_SECONDS = 2
        sample = torch.rand(NUM_CHANNELS, SAMPLE_RATE * NUM_SECONDS, dtype=torch.float32)
        # you can also use CUDA tensors (either with device= or .cuda())!
        
        # construct the pitch shifter
        pitch_shift = PitchShifter(SAMPLE_RATE)
        
        # pitch shift the sample
        SHIFT_SEMITONES = 5
        print(pitch_shift(sample, SHIFT_SEMITONES))
        ```
