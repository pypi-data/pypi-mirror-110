        # Pytest Duration Insights 
        
        This python package offers a small dashboard that helps you investigate
        long running pytest runs. It's built on top of the report that is generated 
        by [pytest-reportlog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog). 
        
        ## Instructions. 
        
        ### 1. Install.
        
        ```
        pip install pytest-reportlog pytest-duration-insights
        ```
        
        ### 2. Make a report. 
        
        ```
        pytest --report-log reportlog.jsonl
        ```
        
        ### 3. Explore!
        
        ```
        pytest-duration-insights explore reportlog.jsonl
        ```
        
        This will start up a service that tries to help you find areas in your
        testing code base that are worth investigating.
        
        ## Preview 
        
        We're hosting a demo of this service on GitHub pages. You can view it 
        [here](https://koaning.github.io/pytest-duration-insights/).
        
        ## Roadmap 
        
        We're only scratching the surface of what the `reportlog.jsonl` file gives us. We might, for
        example, also explore how long it takes to setup/teardown tests. Feedback is appreciated, 
        especially if somebody has a keen insight that has helped in the past.
        
        That said, this project is very much an experiment as well. See it as a thing you could
        try rather than a best practice.
