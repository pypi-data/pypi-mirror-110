PyTyle is an extremely versatile and extensible tiling manager that is meant
to be used on top of EWMH-compliant window managers. Its feature set was modeled after
the basic tiling features of XMonad.

This is a fork of the [original PyTyle](http://github.com/BurntSushi/pytyle1),
adjusted to work with Python 3. Development continues, and you can expect optimizations and bug fixes.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/programical/pytyle1x/wiki) for installation instructions.
