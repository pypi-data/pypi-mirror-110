Disclaimer:


Use a unique and descriptive user agent string, which should include the target platform, a unique application identifier, and a version string.
The following format is recommended: <platform>:<app ID>:<version string>. For example, iOS:com.example.helloworld:v1.0.3.
Don’t lie about your user agent, such as spoofing popular browsers. This is a bannable offense.


Limit the rate of requests to 60 per minute.
The database server is only so powerful. If you think you’ll need a higher request rate, contact Josh before hitting the servers.
