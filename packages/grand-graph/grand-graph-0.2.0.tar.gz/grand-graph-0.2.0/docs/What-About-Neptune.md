# What about Neptune?

## Background

In many industry applications, graph databases are commonly used for "shallow" graph queries â€” in other words, queries that rely heavily on node-wise or edge-wise indexing, but not too heavily on multiple hops along graph relations. For example, "find all purchases made by this set of users," or "find all movies with actors that also acted in a movie this user has rated five stars." These queries benefit greatly from the graph structure of the database, but do not involve deep or complete graph traversals. 

In contrast with these common industry needs, mathematical or scientific graph algorithms are notoriously hard to profile, and predicting workload for arbitrary data science manipulations on a graph is a major challenge in many big-data graph or network-science applications. Graph queries may frequently involve traversing every node or edge in a graph, or performing some accumulative function across a graph. So-called "deep" graph queries include subgraph isomorphism search, graph matching, and pathfinding.

## AWS Neptune

[AWS Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/getting-started/) is a graph database as a service provided by Amazon Web Services. Though it says "serverless" on the packaging, there are a few considerations to be aware of:

* Neptune requires that you provision a "server-equivalent" amount of compute power. For example, you can provision a single EC2 instance's worth of compute, in which case it is equivalent to running a graph database on a single node for writes. ([Reads can be parallelized across a provisioned cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/intro.html))
* Unlike DynamoDB, Neptune does not have an on-demand auto-scaling feature. In other words, if you rapidly double the number of queries you're running per second in DynamoDB, it meets your need. If you rapidly double the number of queries you send to Neptune, it may very likely fail. [[DynamoDB Auto-Scaling Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.html)]

This means for certain sparse or bursty use-cases, Neptune may be _dramatically_ more expensive. For example, consider these cases:

### Neptune's pricing model excels:

* Homogenous or predictable workload, consistent algorithmic complexity at all hours.
  * For example: An e-commerce site that maps users to recommended products.
* Adiabatic (gradual) changes to server load that take place over many minutes or hours (to give auto-scaling software time to adapt)
  * For example: A social media website with traffic patterns that match common wake/sleep cycles across time-zones

### Neptune's pricing model may be disadvantageous:
* A large workload runs periodically but infrequently, for short periods of time
  * For example: A web-crawler that runs every hour to identify and link new pharmaceutical research literature
* A user can trigger an arbitrary graph database algorithm via API
  * For example: Users have direct control over the executiion of complex queries across a graph

As a workaround, [Grand](https://github.com/aplbrain/grand) rewrites graph operations in an abstracted graph API representation, and then implements these calls as operations on a DynamoDB table. In other words, Grand acts as an abstraction layer to enable bursty workloads with arbitrary datastore backends (DynamoDB, SQLite, NetworkX in memory). This is _less efficient_ than using a graph database like Neptune, but it frees the user to pay only for the compute and resources that they are using.

## Discussion

Neptune is still a relatively young product, and I'm hopeful that AWS will consider adding "true-serverless" pricing models, as they have done with "on-demand" DynamoDB pricing and, more recently, Aurora (though [this is still in preview](https://pages.awscloud.com/AmazonAuroraServerlessv2Preview.html)).

In the medium-term, it is possible to engineer your own scaling software for Neptune that listens for traffic and scales up to meet demand. This capability is currently out of scope for the Grand library.
