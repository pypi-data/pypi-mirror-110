Incenp.Click-Shell Manual
=========================

Incenp.Click-Shell is an extension to `click`_ that easily turns your
Click-powered command-line application into a shell utility. It is built
on top of the built-in Python `cmd`_ module, with modifications to make
it work with click.

Incenp.Click-Shell is compatible with Python versions 3.7 above, and
with Click versions 6.0 and above. It is distributed under a 3-clause
BSD license.


Features
--------

* Adds a “shell” mode **with command completion** to any click app.
