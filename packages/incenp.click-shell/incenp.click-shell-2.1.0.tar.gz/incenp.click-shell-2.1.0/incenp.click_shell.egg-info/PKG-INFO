Description: Incenp.Click-Shell - A shell extension for Click
        ================================================
        
        Incenp.Click-Shell is an extension to `click`_ that easily turns your
        Click-powered Python command-line application into a shell utility. It
        is built on top of the built in Python `cmd`_ module, with modifications
        to make it work with Click.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Adds a "shell" mode **with command completion** to any Click app.
        * Just a one line change for most click apps.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Simply replace ``@click.group`` with ``@incenp.click_shell.shell`` on
        the root level command:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import click
            from incenp.click_shell import shell
        
            # @click.group()  # no longer
            @shell(prompt='my-app> ', intro='Starting my app...')
            def my_app():
                pass
        
            @my_app.command()
            def testcommand():
                click.echo("testcommand is running")
        
            # more commands
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                my_app()
        
        
        When run, you should expect an output like so:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python my_app.py
            Starting my app...
            my-app> testcommand
            testcommand is running
            my-app>
        
        Using the Incenp.Click-Shell decorator alters the functionality of your
        program **only** when the program is called without a subcommand
        argument. Otherwise, your app will function identically to how it did
        before.
        
        
        History
        -------
        
        Incenp.Click-Shell is a fork of Clark Perkins’ `click-shell`_, motivated
        by the lack of recent development in the original project and in
        particular the lack of support for recent versions of Click, which
        introduced changes that completely broke the original ``click-shell``.
        
        Incenp.Click-Shell is used in exactly the same way as the original
        ``click-shell``, the only difference being that the module to import is
        named ``incenp.click_shell`` instead of ``click_shell``.
        
        Importantly, in this fork Python 2 support has been completely removed.
        If support for Python 2 is important for you, then you may keep using
        the original ``click-shell`` module instead; it won’t work with Click 8,
        but if you’re using Python 2 you’re stuck with older versions of Click
        anyway, since Click 8 also dropped support for Python 2.
