# GaiaCurves!

## Motivation
The package is supposed to give the light curves of variable stars from Gaia Data Releases (1 and 2) with a star name that can be resolved by SIMBAD. It eliminates the need of checking different folders/without going through the task of using separate CSV files and cross-matching tables or Datalink from Gaia, and can work on several stars at once (passed through a CSV)
