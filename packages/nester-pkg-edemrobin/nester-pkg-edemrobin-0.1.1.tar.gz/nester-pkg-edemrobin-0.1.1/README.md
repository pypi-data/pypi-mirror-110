# Example Package

This is the â€œnester.py" module, and it provides one function called
list_fun() which prints lists that may or may not include nested lists.

 This function takes a positional argument called "data", which is any
    Python list (of, possibly, nested lists). Each data item in the provided list
    is (recursively) printed to the screen on its own line.
