# aSc to ManageBac

## Getting started

Requires Python 3.6 or above. Install it.

Open the terminal or command line, and peform the following:

```sh
pip install asc2mb
```

If for some reason the `pip` command doesn't work, try the following:

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

After `pip install` worked, it is now installed on your path, and the command `asc2mb` is not available. It takes three arguments, usage information can be found via typing the command with no arguments.

If there is some error with the arguments you supplied, such as cannot read the xml, or something else, it'll let you know.

```ssh
asc2mb path_to_xml path_to_classes_output_file path_to_timetable_output_file
```
