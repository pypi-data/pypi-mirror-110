        A simple object oreinted  population synthesis framework designed for testing population inference in Stan.
        It has grown passed its orginal intent to be able to produce populations/catalogs from a variety of luminosity functions, redshift distributions, and even more abstractions. Documentation coming soon.
        It also makes a lot of pretty pictures.
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install popsynth
        ```
        
        
        Note: **This is not synth pop!** If you were looking for some hard driving beats out of a yamaha keyboard with bells... look elsewhere
