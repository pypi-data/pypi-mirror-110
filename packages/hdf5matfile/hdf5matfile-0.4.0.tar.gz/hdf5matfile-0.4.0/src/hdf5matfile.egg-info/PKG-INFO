Description: hdf5matfile
        ===========
        
        Load data from v7.3 \*.mat files. Only reading is supported, no writing.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Provides a class ``Hdf5Matfile`` and a convience function ``load_hdf5mat``.
        
        To load all the variables from the file, use ``Hdf5Matfile.load_file``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with Hdf5Matfile(filename) as file:
                data = file.load_file()
        
        To fully load a specific variable from disk, use ``Hdf5Matfile.load_variable``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with Hdf5Matfile(filename) as file:
                results = file.load_variable('results')
        
        For partial loading, a mapping/dict-like interface is also supported:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with Hdf5Matfile(filename) as file:
                results = file['results']
                time = results[0, :]
                disp = results[1, :]
                ...
        
        If you're not using a context manager, make sure to close the file after
        you're done:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            file = Hdf5Matfile(filename)
            data = file.load_file()
            ...
            file.close()
        
        By default, arrays are not squeezed; since MATLAB represents even scalars
        as 2-D arrays, this means that something you expect to be a scalar will in
        fact be a 1-by-1 np.ndarray. You can change this by passing ``squeeze=True``
        to the constructor:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with Hdf5Matfile(filename, squeeze=True) as file:
                data = file.load_file()
        
        
        Supported data types
        --------------------
        
        Data type support is pretty limited; this isn't a terribly fancy class.
        Supported MATLAB data types, and the Python objects or NumPy dtypes they map
        to:
