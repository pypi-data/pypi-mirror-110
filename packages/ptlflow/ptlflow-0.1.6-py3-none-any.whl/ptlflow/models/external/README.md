# External models

Models in this folder are taken and adapted from other external sources (usually from the authors of the respective model).
These models are more ideal for inference and validation, as they can use the weights made available in the original source (if available).
However, it is not guaranteed that they can also be successfully trained inside this framework, as they may require different training routines than what it is implemented here.

Each model and its respective weights are available under different licenses and conditions, as specified by the original sources. Inside each folder there will be a description containing a reference to the original source.
