        Example:
        
        Say you obtain skater data for the KHL in 2020-2021 and store that as a dataframe called <code>output</code>. You can run this function to get bio information for every player in that league's scrape.
        
        <code>output = tdhepscrape.get_skaters("khl", "2020-2021")</code>
        
        <code>tdhepscrape.get_player_information(output)</code>
