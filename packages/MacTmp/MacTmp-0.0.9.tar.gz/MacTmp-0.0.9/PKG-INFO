Description: # MacTmp
        
        This is a python module used to find the temperatures of the CPU and GPU in Mac OS. If there is an issue with this module, please open an issue. 
        
        Installation: `pip3 install MacTmp`
        
        Please run this with `sudo`
        
        Run: `sudo python3 file.py`
        
        Below is the example code:
        
        ```python3
        >>> import MacTmp
        >>> print(MacTmp.CPU_Temp())  # To get CPU Temperature
        >>> print(MacTmp.GPU_Temp())  # To get GPU Temperature
        ```
        
        Both temperatures are in Celcius. 
        
        Note: GPU temperature does not work with Intel Integrated Graphics. This module doesn't work with Mac Mini's, and support for M1 Macs is untested. This module relies on `powermetrics`, so if that command works, this module should work.
