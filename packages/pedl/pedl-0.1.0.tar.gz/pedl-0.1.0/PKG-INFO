Description: # PEDL
        
        PEDL is a tool for predicting protein-protein assocations from the biomedical literature.
        It searches more than 30 million abstracts of biomedical publications and over 4 million
        full texts with the help of [PubTatorCentral](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/).
        A state-of-the-art machine reading model then predicts which types of association between the proteins
        are supported by the literature. Among others, PEDL can detect posttranslational modifications, 
        transcription factor-target interactions, complex formations and controlled transports.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install pedl
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        PEDL expects proteins to be identified via entrez gene ids. 
        These can be looked up via standard webinterfaces like
        [NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene).
        
        ### Prediction
        
        * Interactions between single proteins:
            ```bash
            pedl --p1 29126 --p2 54918 --out PEDL_predictions
            ```
          Results:
          ```bash
          $ ls PEDL_predictions/
          CD274-CMTM6.txt  CMTM6-CD274.txt
          
          $ head -n1 PEDL_predictions/CD274-CMTM6.txt
          in-complex-with	0.98	6978769	A PD-L1 antibody, H1A, was developed to destabilize PD-L1 by disrupting the <e1>PD-L1</e1> stabilizer <e2>CMTM6</e2>.	PEDL
          ```
        
        
        
        * Pairwise interactions between multiple proteins:
          ```bash
          pedl --p1 29126 --p2  54918 920  --out PEDL_predictions
          ```
          searches for interactions between 29126 and 54918, and for interactions between 29126 and 920
        
        
        * Read protein lists from files:
          ```bash
          pedl --p1 proteins.txt --p2  54918 920  --out PEDL_predictions
          ```
          searches for interactions between the proteins in `proteins.txt` and 54918, as well as interactions between proteins in `proteins.txt` and 920
          
        
        * If the provided gene ids are from human, mouse, rat or zebrafish, PEDL can automatically
          search for interactions in the other model species (currently human, mouse, rat and zebrafish)
          via homology classes defined by the [Alliance of Genome Resources](http://www.informatics.jax.org/homology.shtml):
          
            ```bash
            pedl --p1 29126 --p2 54918 --out PEDL_predictions --expand_species mouse zebrafish
            ```
            would also include interactions in mouse and zebrafish.
        
        
        * It is also possible to query PathwayCommons for interactions. 
          This requires the python package `indra` to be installed, which can be achieved
          via `pip install indra`:
          ```bash
            pedl --p1 29126 --p2 54918 --out PEDL_predictions --dbs pid reactome kegg
          ```
          to query `pid` `reactome` and `kegg`. See `--help` for the full list of available
          databases.
          
          
        
        
        ### Prediction for large gene lists  
        If you need to test for more than 100 interactions at once, you have to use a local copy 
        of PubTatorCentral, which can be downloaded [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/PubTatorCentral/PubTatorCentral_BioCXML/).
        Unpack the PubTatorCentral files and point PEDL towards the files:
          ```bash
          pedl --p1 large_protein_list1.txt --p2 large_protein_list2 --out PEDL_predictions --pubtator [PATH_TO_PUBTATOR]
          ```
        
        In this case, it is also strongly advised to use a CUDA-compatible GPU to speed up the machine reading:
          ```bash
          pedl --p1 large_protein_list1.txt --p2 large_protein_list2 --out PEDL_predictions
            --pubtator [PATH_TO_PUBTATOR]--device cuda
          ```
